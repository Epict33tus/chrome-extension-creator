# chrome-extension-creator

Quickly start your chrome extension project with a working example from google.

Usage:

    npm i -g chrome-extension-creator

Then run one of the following commands in a directory you want a project folder in:
Project name in this example: 'my-body-is-chrome'

    cec my-body-is-chrome

or

    cce my-body-is-chrome

or

    create-chrome-extension my-body-is-chrome

or

    chrome-extension-creator my-body-is-chrome

if a folder doesn't exist with the name 'my-body-is-chrome', it will create google's base example in a directory with the name 'my-body-is-chrome' and you will get this message:

    DONE!
        run:
        cd my-body-is-chrome

        have fun!
